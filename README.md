This is a library to serialize PHP variables in JSON format. It is similar of the `serialize()` function in PHP,
but the output is a string JSON encoded. You can also unserialize the JSON generated by this tool and have you
PHP content back.

**Supported features**:
- Encode/Decode of scalar, null, array
- Encode/Decode of objects, including all the [`DateTime family objects`](http://php.net/manual/es/book.datetime.php)  (except `DatePeriod`).
- Support nested serialization
- Support not declared properties on the original class definition (ie, properties in `stdClass`)
- Support object recursion

**Unsupported serialization content**:
- Resource (ie, `fopen()` response)
- Closures
- Binary String or malformed UTF8 strings (ie, resulsts from `SELECT AES_ENCRYPT(:content, :key) as encrypted`)
	- These strings will need to be properly handled by converting to hex using `bin2hex` or `utf8_encode` in the `__sleep()` method
- `DatePeriod` due to its built-in nature, but its results, an array of `DateTime` can be successfully serialized.
 
This project should not be confused with `JsonSerializable` interface from PHP 5.4. This interface is used on
`json_encode` to encode the objects. There is no unserialization with this interface, differently from this project.

*Json Serializer requires PHP >= 5.4*

## Example

```php

class MyCustomClass {
	public $isItAwesome = true;
	protected $nice = 'very!';
}

$instance = new MyCustomClass();

$serializer = new Zumba\Util\JsonSerializer();
$json = $serializer->serialize($instance);
// $json will contain the content {"@type":"MyCustomClass","isItAwesome":true,"nice":"very!"}

$restoredInstance = $serializer->unserialize($json);
// $restoredInstance will be an instance of MyCustomClass
```

## How to Install

If you are using composer, install the package [`zumba/json-serializer`](https://packagist.org/packages/zumba/json-serializer).

```
$ composer require zumba/json-serializer
```

Or add the `zumba/json-serializer` directly in your `composer.json` file.

If you are not using composer, you can just copy the files from `src` folder in your project.
